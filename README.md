Hey guys, If you want to know more on git complete the code academy course above. 

The link below is the sound library we can use.
http://p5js.org/reference/#/libraries/p5.sound

Specifically these methods,

http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.AudioIn -  Used to input and read audio from a mic on the computer. 

http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Amplitude - Used to measure the amplitude, and will return amplitude as a measure between 0 and 1. We can use the amplitude return data to map to an output. EX(Alpha, Color, Location, etc etc)

http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.PeakDetect -  Used to detect the peak frequency. We can use the frequency peaks to alter output on the blob. EX( Frequency peaks Blob size grows etc etc)

http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.FFT -  Used to measure frequency/amplitude, we can mess around with this to try to map it to an output. 

http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.SoundRecorder - Used for playback of audio(save button).

Look around in the sound libraries and feel free to add, edit, or post anything good you find that we can use.
